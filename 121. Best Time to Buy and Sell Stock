//Logic of the problem
//Treat 1st element as lowest price
//Iterate through array and check is there any other element lowest then 1st then reinilitize that as lowest price
//If no element is lowest then substract that element with lowest element and see which element has maximum profit

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy=prices[0];
        int max_profit=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i] < buy){
                buy = prices[i];
            }else if(prices[i] - buy > max_profit){
                max_profit = prices[i] - buy;
            }
        
            }
            return max_profit;
